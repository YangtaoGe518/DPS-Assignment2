Pacman Protocol Specification
=============================

Terminology
===========

This specification uses following terminologies to distinguish between
accessing pacman and several game object (i.e. food, ghost etc):

    # LOCAL: the game object is a local game object, and is currently on
             the local screen
    # AWAY: our pacman is current away on the remote screen.
    # REMOTE: a game object on the remote screen that our AWAY pacman 
              might interact with
    # FOREIGN: the other player's pacman. when it is visiting our screen

In this document, when these terms are capitalized, they have these specific 
meanings.

This Protocol runs over TCP, using port 9872. There are 11 message types:   // here I am not sure what does 9872 here means

    # maze update
    # FOREIGN pacman arrive
    # FOREIGN pacman left
    # FOREIGN pacman died
    # pacman go home
    # pacman update
    # ghost update
    # FOREIGN pacman ate ghost
    # eat
    # score update
    # status update

The network is required to exchange the messages 'maze update','pacman update',
'ghost update', 'score update' and 'status update' every frame in the game. 
'FOREIGN pacman arrive' message is only sent when FOREIGN pacman arrives the 
LOCAL maze. 'FOREIGN pacman left' is only sent when FOREIGN pacman leave the 
LOCAL maze. 'FOREIGN pacman died' is sent when FOREIGN pacman dies on local 
screen. 'pacman go home' is sent when AWAY pacman is forcibly sent home. 
'FOREIGN pacman ate ghost' is sent when FOREIGN pacman eats LOCAL ghost. 'eat' is
sent when LOCAL food is eaten. // this paragraph need to be modified
